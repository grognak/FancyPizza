        "Prepare the Easy Supermarket Dough as per it's recipe but split the dough in half before the final rest.",
        "Preheat your oven as high as it can go (500-550) for at least 30 minutes (usually I do 45 minutes).",
        "While the oven is preheating prepare the Easy Tinned Tomato Sauce as per the recipe.",
        "Once the oven is preheated work each doughball by gently stretching it out via your desired method and place on your pizza peel or cooking pan.",
        "Parbake the crust for 3 minutes.",
        "Once the crust is parbaked turn on your broiler.",
        "Ladle your tomato sauce onto the crust and spread it out working from the outside in towards the center of the pizza.",
        "Spread the Mozzarella & Cheddar Blend cheese around the sauce in a thin layer.",
        "Working from the outside of the pizza in towards the center lay the pepperonis out with their ends overlapping (Don't worry the pepperoni will shrink while cooking).",
        "Pop the pizza into the oven and bake for about 5-7 minutes or until the cheese on the pizza is starting to turn a golden brown.",
        "Pull the pizza out of the oven, sprinkle on the grated pecorino, slice, and serve!",
        "Repeat the steps above for the second doughball."
